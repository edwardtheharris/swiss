## Overview

This simple HTTP 1.1 static web server is written in Python 3
utilizing the Uvicorn library for the HTTP server component.

uvicorn (e.g. `pip3 install uvicorn` if on Ubuntu).
Only tested in Linux systems (including Microsoft WSL).

Please note that this application is a very simple program, therefore no
extensive performance and security testing has been performed. There isn't
any guarantee of protection against security breach, denial of service attacks,
etc.

## Usage

Simply run the `simplewebserver.py` from the `src` folder using Python 3
interpreter. Ensure that the other python files in the `src` folder from
this repository accompany the main python program.

Another way to run this program is by renaming `simplewebserver.py` to
`__main__.py`, zip archive the program with the other python files from
the `src` folder, and then execute the zip file directly using the Python 3
interpreter (e.g. `python3 simplewebserver.zip`).

By default, the program will serve files and folders in the current working
directory for all hosts at port 8080. Use the command line switch to change
those parameters. For more info, run the program with `--help` argument.
